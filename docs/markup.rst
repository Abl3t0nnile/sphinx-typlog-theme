Here is an example on code highlight::

    @app.route('/', methods=['GET')
    def hello(name='world'):
        return 'Hello {}'.format(name)

    class API(object):
        """API docstring style"""

        def __init__(self, request):
            # comment
            self.request = request

Quote
~~~~~

Here is an example on block quote:

    | Beautiful is better than ugly.
    | Explicit is better than implicit.
    | Simple is better than complex.
    | Complex is better than complicated.
    | Flat is better than nested.
    | Sparse is better than dense.
    | Readability counts.
    | Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    | Although practicality beats purity.
    | Errors should never pass silently.
    | Unless explicitly silenced.
    | In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    | There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    | Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    | Now is better than never.
    | Although never is often better than *right* now.
    | If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    | If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    | Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
